title: What is the best programming language to create and maintain your startup project?

One of the biggest challenges that people encounter while starting a new project,
is to choose the most appropriate programming language.

There are various factors about different programming languages that people should
consider. Like:

  - **Purpose**
  - **Efficiency**
  - **Suitability**
  - **Performance**
  - **Error checking**
  - **Ease of development**
  - ...

And most of them say that they want to use the
fastest language so that it can handle thousands of requests in the smallest
fraction of time. But is that the only thing to worry about?

So let's imagine we want to create a back-end application, there are some
languages that people would consider. Like:

  - **PHP**
  - **Ruby**
  - **Python**
  - **NodeJS**

And many famous websites have used these languages, for example:

  - PHP - [Facebook](https://facebook.com)
  - Ruby - [Github](htpts://github.com)
  - Python - [YouTube](https://youtube.com)
  - NodeJS - [eBay](https://ebay.com)

And based on some benchmarks and articles that I will mention in the end of this
article, **Nodejs** has the best performance and it's able to reply steadily at
nearly 8,000 requests per second.

But, we can mention some low-level, statically-typed and compiled languages that
have a much better performance in comparison with NodeJS. Like:

  - **C** / **C++**
  - **Rust**
  - **Golang**

If we compare Rust with NodeJS, we can easily understand that Rust has a much
better performance and can handle about 70,000 RPS! And also Rust is more secure.

So why don't we build our website with these kinds of languages? Why are there so
many websites build with PHP or Ruby when they suck at performance?

But there is something that we have to consider: _Speed is not everything_.
You don't need to use the best language in order to create your startup. Because
they take so much time and afford from your programmers. You just need to produce
an MVP version so that people can give you feedback! And also using high-level
languages like PHP or Python is much more simpler, cheaper, and faster to develop.
So you can build your startup in less time!

After you get the feedback from users and you're sure that your startup is going to
be successful, you can think of changing the main language of the project.
Otherwise, it's too risky to use high performance languages at first!
You can ask the developers that are working on successful companies and they will
surely tell you that they don't use the code that was used to produce the first version
of the program or even the code that was used 5 years ago for that program.
They have changed it all. Or they have even used another language.

So at this moment I ask myself, why there are so many famous websites that despite
their certain success, haven't used a better languages and are keep using the same
language so far?

For example Facebook is built with PHP and it's still using PHP as the main back-end
language. Why don't they change the language?

I can think of some reasons:

First, changing the main language is too risky and developers may come up with
some weird errors. You can maintain new services of your project with new languages
and still keep the language of the main service.

Second, it's too expensive for the company to hire expert developers to re-write
the whole project with the new language so that it can respond just like before
but faster.

They can easily spend that money improving their servers! In this way, they are
making the app faster without any losses.
